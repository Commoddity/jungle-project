    <p>"Wicked, wicked jungle is massive" is one of those refrains that you know before you hear, a sound plugged into our collective consciousness like the riff in Deep Purple's "Smoke On The Water" and the booming chortle of Brian Blessed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The track represents one of those rare moments when everything comes together exactly on cue; the jungle scene had been bubbling away for a couple of years and was primed for a definitive record, Levy had discovered his own vocal niche and M-Beat was a burgeoning producer in search of his opus. From 1991 to the year of its release in '94, you could still just about describe jungle as operating on an underground level, but the scene was expanding rapidly. What "Incredible" did was consolidate that festering mainstream potential and turn it into something gargantuan, galvanising more people to sit up and listen and removing any remaining semblance of exclusivity — for better or worse. Prior to '94, all the major releases – Bodysnatch's "Euphony", Doc Scott's "Here Come The Drums", Lennie De Ice's "We Are I.E." – had remained harboured in key areas of London, on the pirate airwaves and in a network of soundsystems, but the release of "Incredible" and SHY FX's "Original Nuttah" (another '94 classic) marked a second phase in the scene's popularity. Now, over 20 years on, "Jungle is massive" has become the unofficial motto for the entire movement and "Incredible" remains, arguably, its most recognisable tune. It's even become the punchline of a shit joke. Why did the lion get lost? Not many other songs can say that.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It's easy to look back with fondness on "Incredible". It permeates top DJs' list of favourite jungle bangers, still has that ability to titillate both aged and adolescent toes on sticky, rum-splattered dancefloors and can enlist an infinite amount of fire emojis. But, soon after its release, the tune and General Levy were marred by controversy and blacklisted from the scene. In an interview with The Face, Levy was quoted as saying "I run jungle" which many of jungle's top brass in its 'committee' thought endangered its camaraderie; putting one name, face and voice above the movement itself was not something that could be allowed to happen and so "Incredible" was banned from venues and the pirate airways. The community shunned Levy and M-Beat.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ironically, the decline of Jungle perhaps had more to do with the overbearing bureaucracy employed by this committee than it did with "Incredible". Despite the mainstream success of the track, there's still an atmosphere of deep set affection that hangs from the shoulders of jungle and instead of destroying it, "Incredible" only helped to widen its scope — and only the snobbiest of purists would ever argue that that's a bad thing. 20 years on, it's a track that people still love and still play out. In fact, it's had something of a renaissance in the last year or so.</p>
